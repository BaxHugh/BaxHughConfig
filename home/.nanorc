## The <Ctrl+Delete> keystroke deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
## On some terminals the <Ctrl+Backspace> keystroke produces ^H, which is
## the ASCII character for backspace, so it is bound by default to the
## backspace function.  The <Backspace> key itself produces a different
## keycode, which is hard-bound to the backspace function.  So, if you
## normally use <Backspace> for backspacing and not ^H, you can make
## <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor with:
bind ^H chopwordleft main

## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment these:
unbind ^K main
unbind ^U all
unbind ^N main
unbind ^Y all
unbind M-J main
unbind M-T main
bind ^X cut main
bind ^C copy main
bind ^V paste all
bind ^Q exit all
bind ^S savefile main
bind ^W writeout main
bind ^O insert main
#set multibuffer
## ^H is ctrl backspace on some systems so comment this
#bind ^H help all
#bind ^H exit help
bind ^F whereis all
bind ^G findnext all
bind ^B wherewas all
bind ^D findprevious all
bind ^R replace main
bind ^Z undo main
bind ^Y redo main
bind ^A mark main
bind ^P location main
bind ^T gotoline main
bind ^T gotodir browser
bind ^T cutrestoffile execute
bind ^L linter execute
bind ^E execute main
